# Networker

A simple CLI to monitor a local area network (LAN).  

 Navigate to the repo directory and utilize the `networker` bash script for easy access. Try `./networker --help` to get started!

> **Note:** Scapy requires admin privileges for ARP requests so `sudo` is utilized in the bash script.

## Initial Commands
 - Utilize the `./networker init` command to seed the sqlite database with port reference data.
 - Utilize the `./networker network init` command to scan and log network and device information.
