# Networker

A simple CLI to monitor a local area network (LAN).  

 Navigate to the repo directory and utilize the `networker` bash script for easy access. Try `./networker --help` to get started!  

 See [CLI Documentation](docs/cli.md) for detailed command usage.

> **Note:** Scapy requires admin privileges for ARP requests so `sudo` is utilized.
